**Mint** is a small, fast documentation generator for
[literate-style programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
that produces HTML files from your source code. In literate programming, the emphasis is
placed on writing clear documentation in ordinary human language instead of writing terse
half-sentences. The code is considered merely an artifact of the documentation. Thus, in Mint
the documentation is displayed most prominently, right alongside the fragments of code to
which each section pertains.

Mint was inspired by (and borrows heavily from) [Docco](http://github.com/jashkenas/docco),
with the main difference being that Mint is written in JavaScript instead of
[CoffeeScript](http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script). Code comments are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and templates use
[Mustache](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache/).

### Installation

To install Mint, download the [tarball](http://github.com/mjijackson/mint/tarball/master) or clone
the repository.

    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/mint.git

### Usage

    $ bin/mint --help
    $ bin/mint -o docs lib/*.js

### Credits

Mint uses the following libraries to get the job done:

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
  - [markdown-js](http://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)
  - [Mu](http://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu)
  - [optparse-js](http://github.com/jfd/optparse-js)

### Requirements

Mint runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to
highlight source code, so you'll need both of these installed on your system in order to
use it.

### License

Mint is released under the terms of the MIT license. Please read the LICENSE file for more
